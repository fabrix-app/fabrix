# Our Tapestry

## Purpose

The fabrix.app team maintains this document to serve as a forward-looking plan for how the framework will grow and evolve. The goal of the roadmap is to assist developers in planning the future of their projects. Please submit an Issue or Pull Request if you feel that something should be added or changed in this document, and we are happy to discuss.

## Organization

Each major and minor release will be represented by a Github Milestone. Each major version series will be developed on a separate branch. Please submit feature requests, bug reports, and other suggestions as Github Issues for inclusion in a future release.

## Release Schedule

Fabrix intentionally parallels its release schedule with the [Node.js release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-plan).

Major and minor version releases occur according to a regular calendar schedule, and versions are assigned according to semver. Major releases occur in April. The Fabrix team releases a minor version once per month with the latest feature updates for the current series. The fifth minor release, in October of the same year, will be tagged for LTS (Long Term Support) which lasts 18 months.
